Functionality-4
All the possible functions of complex arithmatic are included in program.
Also for the user's pleasure two constructor's has been provided so that one can have either an intilized complex 0+0i OR one can enter the required values to get
required complex number.

Reliability-5
The program is tested for various critical input values and it is reliable.
critical inputs include 0+0i,0+xi,x+0i
Note:In division function one cannot put the denominator = 0+0i

Usability-4
The program has been written in very simple and straight forward way and can e easily undertstood.
Names of the functions are appropriatly chosen.Message has been given at ths start for clarification.

Maintainability-5
All the functions are robust and very self explaining in nature and can be easily modified as per the need.
For example I have preferred not to return anything in function for addition and to just update the variable itself but if required it can be made into a returning funtion.
I have tried to minimize the number of arguments and variables used.So in case of maintainance one does'nt have to mdify too much.Also prper documentation 
has been done by writting appropriate comments at appropriate places.
